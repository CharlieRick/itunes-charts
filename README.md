# iTunes Charts App

The aim for this project was to create a responsive site that uses an API.

I used the iTunes Chart API as my data source and used AJAX to display the information on the page without refreshing. Every time a filter value is changed, an AJAX request is made. Nearly all of the content on the site is generated by JavaScript.
